# pomodoro-timer-electron ⏳⚡

This is a pomodoro timekeeping app I created during this livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6935AFORyM&feature=youtu.be

### how to install the timer on your device

- open the project and run `npm install`
- run `npm run make`
- run the setup in the newly created "/out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/ssetup.exe" on windows. Mac and Linux will probably have similar folders 😂
